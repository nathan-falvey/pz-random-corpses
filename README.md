# Project Zomboid Random Corpses

A repo mod forked from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3231344297&searchtext=Random+Corpses). This one uses the same spawn method but does not spawn trash tiles.


## Installation

To use this mod, extract the zip file to the '**mods**' your Project Zomboid directory. This is normally located in:

```bash
    C:\Users\%username%\Zomboid\
```

Your newly created folder should be in the root of your '**mods**' folder. So it looks like

```bash
    C:\Users\%username%\Zomboid\mods\Random Corpses
```
